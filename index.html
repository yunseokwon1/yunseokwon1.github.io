<h1>Prejudice In Our Blood</h1> 


<b>I believe all humans should have equal rights.</b> 
<div>Many may point out the flaws in this opinion and contradict feminism. No male is born any differently from a female, no female is inferior to a male. It goes both ways. Women and Mens are people of rights and both have the right to stand up for themselves and from where they belong. We should not judge from our color, our blemishes, how rich we are and of course, who we are and what we define ourselves to be. We can make mistakes, mistakes are accidents we always make no matter the gender. </div>
<div>Nobody is fake, kids are not fake, womens are not fake, we are real and we can be the change that creates a new world. </div>

<div>Mary Wollstonecraft is an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of women's rights according to wikipedia. She spoke and stood up for many womens and created a path for us to follow. Not many thought that a female can lead and be the one to take power over many others, Mary Wollstonecraft taught those wrong. One of the quotes she wrote was 
<i> “I do not wish them [women] to have power over men; but over themselves.”</i>and I can see that she wasn’t just feminism, but also fighting justice for both men and women. We must not be biased by either genders and limit their potential of what they can do and become. So let's stand up for ourselves, families, friends and for others when in need. There is no need for prejudice in the room. It should be that we are able to now shamelessly fight for what is right and call to action, starting off with sharing ideas of feminism around. </div>
